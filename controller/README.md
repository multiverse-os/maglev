# Controllers
A controller is the action or function called by a route. Typically a controller
is associated to a Model but is not necsesarily associated with a model. 

The controller has both the ability to select the view to be rendered and access
to the request data. Usually some interaction with a model occurs and then two
or more different options rendered as result. Controllers should be minimal.
